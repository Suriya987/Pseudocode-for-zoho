Can you combine the following two statements into one?

char *p;
p = (char*) malloc(100);

char p = *malloc(100);
char *p = (char) malloc(100);
char *p = (char*)malloc(100);
char *p = (char *)(malloc*)(100);

Ans:  char *p = (char*)malloc(100);

The malloc function creates a memory in heap memory and returns void pointer. which can be converted into any pointer type. now so char *p=(char *)malloc(sizeof(int)*10);

The correct syntax to create a pointer of a specific type is:- <data type> *(pointer name);

Prototype of malloc = ptr = (data type *)malloc(size);


Nowhere,

size(int)*10 means want to create 20 bytes of memory.
malloc(sizeof(int)*10) means 20 bytes of memory created by malloc function in heap memory.
now malloc function returns void pointer. A void pointer can convert into any other pointer type.
(char *)malloc(sizeof(int)*n)

Here we had converted the void pointer into char pointer.
