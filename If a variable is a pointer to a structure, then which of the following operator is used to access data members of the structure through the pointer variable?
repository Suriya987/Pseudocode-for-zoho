If a variable is a pointer to a structure, then which of the following operator is used to access data members of the structure through the pointer variable?
.
&
*
->


Ans : ->

The eg Syntax is;

struct node
{
int data;
};
main(){
struct node p,*a;
P.data=10;
a=&p;
printf(" %d",a->data);
}

And Output is 10.


When ever we want to fetch the value out of a pointer variable which is store in a structure.

We always use -> (arrow) pointer.

On the other hand if in a structure we have a simple variable of any data type we will use .(dot) operator to fetch the value from a variable.
