output of the program If the integer is 4bytes long?

#include<stdio.h>

int main()
{
    int ***r, **q, *p, i=8;
    p = &i;
    q = &p;
    r = &q;
    printf("%d, %d, %d\n", *p, **q, ***r);
    return 0;
}


8, 8, 8
4000, 4002, 4004
4000, 4004, 4008
4000, 4008, 4016

Ans: 8, 8, 8

p-> addr(i)
q-> addr(p)
r-> addr(q)

*p -> val which add is holding in p
**q ->  *q -> addr(i) becoz it is holding p addred *q means value of p ( value is address of i)  
        **q -> value of i so ,8 

***r->   *r -> value of the address it is holding  ( q addr )
          **r ->   p addr  becoz q is holding the address of p which is consider as a value of p
          ***r -> addr of i and it prints the value of i
