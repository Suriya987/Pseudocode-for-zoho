Ans: JACK

Explanation :
printf ("%c", * (int*) vp) ;
Here vp is a void pointer (void * vp)that can hold address of all type of variable.
Lets take an example
void *vp; // void pointer declaration
int a=5; // declaration of variable and assigned to 5
vp=&a;
Normally to show the value of the variable through pointer, we are just appending * before pointer i.e printf("%d",*p) that means it will show value at p . but here it will not show if we will declare like the above. Because vp is a void pointer that means it can hold all data type address .if we simply place *vp then compiler does not identify ..So for that we have to type cast ie (int *)vp ..it indicates vp hold the integer address only .if we wan to see that value just place * (int *)vp..
Then you will get the value of variable..but here %c format specifier used so it will convert that integer value to character value
